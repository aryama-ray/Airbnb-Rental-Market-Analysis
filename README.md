# 1. Introduction
The Airbnb rental market on the West Coast of the United States is diverse, encompassing a wide range of property types, pricing strategies, and guest preferences across neighborhoods. With increasing competition and a growing number of hosts joining the platform, understanding the factors driving performance metrics such as pricing, availability, review scores, and property types has become crucial. Data-driven insights can empower hosts to adapt to market dynamics, enhance guest satisfaction, and improve profitability, while also helping Airbnb maintain host loyalty and platform trust. The primary goal is to deliver actionable insights that enable Airbnb hosts to better understand rentalsâ€™ performance and guest preferences, to build recommendation systems for potential hosts to maximize revenue from the rentals, and to identify trends across neighborhoods. The study uses a comprehensive dataset of over 91,000 Airbnb listings from key counties in California, Oregon, and Washington, comprising 75 features related to host details, property attributes, and market performance.
